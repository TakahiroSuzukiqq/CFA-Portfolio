# Portfolio2  
  This is actually my 2nd portfolio.  
  [my 1st portfolio](https://github.com/TakahiroSuzukiqq/CFA-ProjectNo1-portfolio)  
ã€€ This portfolio was made with the intention to keep it simple.  

# Function  
  With using CSS, HTML and a bit of Javascript in addition to ruby,  
  I could make more simple and beautiful portfolio.  

# Challenges  
  *To activate javascript (actually this is made before I learned javascript in the class).  
  *To think about design, layout.
